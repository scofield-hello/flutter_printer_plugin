# printer

A new flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started
```dart
Printer.print(file.path, "廊坊市司法局自助终端", provider: "PrinterShare");
```

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.
